If you didn't see my <a href="/posts/announcing-experimental-game-jams.html">blog post from 2 weeks ago</a>, I created a website where users can upload their experimental games. Each month there is a theme and users must create a game that demonstrates a completely new type of gameplay that matches the theme.

### The Submissions

January's theme was "GRID", we had a total of 4 submissions (which I think is pretty good for the first ever jam, especially considering this jam was only 2 weeks instead of a month).
Here are the submissions!

### Knightventure (made by <a href="https://experimentaljams.com/account/?user=chartuch" target="_blank">Chartuch</a>)

The first submission was a really cool puzzle game called
"Knightventure". In this game you have movement like the knight from
chess and you must solve puzzles using your limited movement. Despite
not all the puzzles being fully implemented, this game was super
polished and the puzzles were actually very well designed!

### Gupta (made by <a href="https://experimentaljams.com/account/?user=scarbyte" target="_blank">scarbyte</a>)

The second submission was the game that I submitted. Like the last
submission, it is also chess themed. This game is a roguelike with
chess based movement. You can combine different segments of your chess
piece to alter your movement pattern. Looking back, I probably
could've designed this game better because the UI is very confusing
and cryptic.

### To Reach The Light (made by <a href="https://experimentaljams.com/account/?user=dawn" target="_blank">dawn</a>)

The third submission was a neat little puzzle game involving pushing
boxes. The twist is you have you control multiple characters and boxes
of the same color will move together. This leads to some great
and challenging puzzles.

### Creoterra (made by <a href="https://experimentaljams.com/account/?user=errormine" target="_blank">errormine</a>)

The last submission was Creoterra. This is a sandbox terraforming
game. The world will grow on its own as you play (grass will spread,
bees will pollinate flowers, etc). Also, bonus points for the game
being on a hexagonal grid!

### February's Theme is "Ingredients"!
Ingredients can come in many forms... what ingredients will you use to cook up the perfect game?
