# scarbyte-website
The source code for https://scarbyte.com  
This website is built using [txt2web](https://github.com/masonarmand/txt2web), a super simple static site generator I made.  

## Build
To build the site, enter the source directory and use txt2web (replace build_directory with where you want the site to build to):
```
txt2web build_directory
```
